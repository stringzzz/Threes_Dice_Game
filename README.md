# Threes_Dice_Game

Now moved into the early stages of learning JavaScript (Again, for the first time in about a decade). I chose this simple dice game because it is easy to implement, fun, and it gave me a chance to combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into one simple project. There's really not much to it, but it was a fun and educational experience creating it.
